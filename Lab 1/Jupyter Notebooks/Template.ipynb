    "We have been hearing many news about homicide  lately in the mids of already existing Covid-19 pandemic. Violent crime and homicide have been rising saliently across the US. The number of homicide has almost increase by double digits in many bigger cities such has Chicago, New York, Philadelphia just to name few. To have better understanding about criminal and victim profile , to visualize some interesting relation and to make prediction on if the kind of homicide has been solved or unsolved we decided to pick homicide as a topic for our project.\n",
    "\n",
    "Just to define simply, homicide is the killing of one person by another. Homicide might or might not be illegal. Legal homicide could be such as person killing intruders without committing crime or solders killing enemies in battle, while the illegal homicide is an intentional murder of one individual by another or if someone involves in the activities. Our data set has two types of crime: Murder or Manslaughter and Manslaughter by Negligence. Murder occurs when one human being unlawfully kills another human being. Murder are broken into degrees, First degree which is willful, deliberate and premeditated murder. Second-degree murder- which do not carry the death penalty. Manslaughter is the act of killing another human being in a way that is less accountable than murder. In other words manslaughter is not as sever crime as murder. Manslaughter is categorized into voluntary and involuntary manslaughter. Voluntary manslaughter is defined as killing of another human being under extreme provocation which typically does not require an intent to kill. For example an individual who kills another individual in self-defense may be charged with voluntary manslaughter if he was the original attacker in the situation.\n",
    "\n",
    "While involuntary manslaughter is defined as death of another human being due to act of negligence or recklessness of the defendant.For example, a person who drives under the influence of alcohol may hit and kill a pedestrian, although killing him was not his intention.\n",
    "\n",
    "United States does a poor job in tracking and accounting for its unsolved homicides. According to Scripps Howard News Service study of the FBIâ€™s Uniform Crime Report, across U.S. nearly 185,000 cases of homicides and non-negligent manslaughter were unsolved from 1980 to 2008. The rate at which police clear homicides through arrest has declines year over year. About 4 of every 10 homicides go unsolved each year.As per FBI Uniform Crime Report, currently on average, 40 percent of homicides are unsolved. These rising number of unsolved homicides also known as cold case is a major problem to our society as well as law enforcement as its leaving a growing number of killers out on the streets, undermining the safety in urban neighborhoods and also crumbling the confidence in the criminal justice system.\n",
    "\n",
    "No one knows all the names of the murder victims because no law enforcement agency in America is assigned to monitor failed homicide investigations by local police departments. Even the official national statistics on murder are actually estimates and projections based upon incomplete reports by police departments that voluntarily choose (or refuse) to participate in federal crime reporting programs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Keeping all these in mind our primary key in this project is to help classify the cases solved or unsolved based on the data we have.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our dataset come from the Murder Accountability Project which is a nonprofit group organized in 2015 to educate American on the important of accurately accounting for unsolved homicides. Their projects board of directory is composed of retired law enforcement investigators, investigative journalists, criminologists and other experts on various aspects of homicide.\n",
    "\n",
    "--There are two predictions we're working towards--\n",
    "1. Based on attributes of a case (i.e. Year, Month, City, State, Agency, Weapon, Victim attributes, Perpetrator attributes, and Relationship), we can predict if the case will be solved or not.\n",
    "2. Based on attributes in a case (i.e. Year, Month, City, State, Weapon, and Victim attributes), we can profile the Perpetrator (Age, Race, Ethnicity, and Sex)."
